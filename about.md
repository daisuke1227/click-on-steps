# Click on Steps

Like the [Click Between Frames mod](https://github.com/theyareonit/Click-Between-Frames) by syzzi, but without the physics bypass.

In practice, you gain the following benefits:

- Higher precision inputs (up to 240 tps) with no performance loss
- No physics/trigger bugs, including in platformer mode
- Improved bot compatibility
- Improved support for other input devices
- Theoretically leaderboard safe (identical to playing on 240fps). Don't take my word on that.

Unlike CBF, this mod _cannot_ click between steps.
Which is to say, your input precision is fixed at 240 tps.
Unlike CBF, players who typically play the game at 240fps will not receive any benefits from this mod.
This mod is made for players on lower end devices, or devices that don't perform well without VSync.

See the README.md on the GitHub repository for more details.
